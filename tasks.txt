* Check why we get <0,0,0> sometimes from other algos. 
	this might be the key to understanding our problem.
	Anyway - if we never understand this we must add a condition that ignores this,
	or treat it as out of plays.
	As long as we don't collapse.
* Check aviv dll
* unique pointer to get algo
* change *** to vector
* create constructors that free all memory.
* charAt - bottom of page 1.
* remove bad board prints
* score table printing
* make sure bad load of dll does not prevent us from loading next dlls and does not enter vector.
* move to smart pointers when possible
